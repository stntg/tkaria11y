Filing Issues

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.  
2. Open a new issue with a clear title and description.  
3. Include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and environment details (OS, Python version).  
4. Tag the issue with appropriate labels (e.g., bug, feature-request, question).

---

Getting the Code

`bash
git clone git@github.com:stntg/tkaria11y.git
cd tkaria11y
`

---

Setting Up Your Environment

1. Create a virtual environment:
   `bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   `
2. Install the package and dev dependencies:
   `bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install ".[dev]"
   `
3. Generate initial type stubs:
   `bash
   python -m tkaria11y.scripts.generate_stubs
   `

---

Branching Strategy

- Always branch off main for new work.  
- Name branches descriptively:  
  - feature/<short-description>  
  - bugfix/<short-description>  
  - docs/<short-description>  
- Keep branches focused on a single change or feature.

---

Coding Guidelines

Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code.  
- Use black for formatting:
  `bash
  black .
  `
- Lint with flake8 and fix any errors:
  `bash
  flake8 tkaria11y tests
  `

Type Checking

- Keep type hints up to date in code and stubs.  
- Run mypy in strict mode:
  `bash
  mypy tkaria11y
  `

Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality under the tests/ folder.  
- Use pytest for test discovery:
  `bash
  pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q
  `
- Aim for high coverage, especially on accessibility behaviors and edge cases.

Stub Generation

- Whenever WIDGETMAP changes, regenerate stubs:
  `bash
  python -m tkaria11y.scripts.generate_stubs
  `
- Ensure tkaria11y/stubs/widgets.pyi matches the mapped widgets.

Documentation Updates

- Update README.md, docs/, and inline docstrings for new features.  
- Follow the style of existing documentation in docs/index.md.  
- When adding public APIs, include examples and usage snippets.

Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to GitHub:
   `bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   `
2. Open a Pull Request against main.  
3. In your PR description:
   - Reference related issues (e.g., Closes #123).  
   - Summarize your changes and rationale.  
   - List any breaking changes or migration steps.  
4. Ensure CI passes all checks (lint, type, tests, stub generation).  
5. Address review feedback; keep discussions focused and respectful.
