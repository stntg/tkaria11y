Ensuring Full Accessibility Compliance for tkaria11y

To make tkaria11y a truly accessible GUI framework, we’ll align it to the four WCAG 2.1 principles—Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust—and layer in ARIA/OS‐level integration, testing, and documentation. Below is a roadmap, detailed implementation pointers, code snippets, and tooling to hit every major accessibility requirement.

---

1. Perceivable
Ensure UI content can be perceived by all senses.

1. Text Alternatives  
   - Every non-text UI element (images, icon buttons) must have an accessible_description.  
   - In your mixin, enforce a required accessible_name for buttons/icons:
     `python
     if not accessible_name:
         raise ValueError("accessible_name is required for non-text widgets")
     `
2. TTS Announcements  
   - Debounce rapid-focus changes (e.g. on Tab) to avoid chattiness.  
   - Announce role + name + description in logical order:
     `python
     label = f"{self.accessiblerole}, {self.accessiblename}"
     if self.accessible_description:
         label += f", {self.accessible_description}"
     `
3. Contrast & Fonts  
   - Build in WCAG-compliant contrast checker in applyhighcontrast.  
   - Allow custom palettes and validate contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 for text.
   - Embed OpenDyslexic or similar via setdyslexicfont.

2. Operable
Guarantee keyboard and pointer users can operate all functionality.

1. Logical Keyboard Navigation  
   - Replace simple wrapping code with focusable widget list:
     `python
     def configurefocustraversal(root):
         order = [w for w in root.winfo_children() if w.cget("state")!="disabled"]
         for idx, w in enumerate(order):
             nxt = order[(idx+1)%len(order)]
             prv = order[(idx-1)%len(order)]
             w.bind("<Tab>", lambda e, nxt=nxt: (nxt.focus_set(), "break"))
             w.bind("<Shift-Tab>", lambda e, prv=prv: (prv.focus_set(), "break"))
     `
2. Visible Focus Indicator  
   - On <FocusIn>, apply a bright border or overlay via a shared Canvas.  
3. Non-Timing Features  
   - Never rely on hover alone—duplicate hover announcements with focus events.  
4. Gesture Alternatives  
   - For customtkinter gestures, map pinch/zoom to keyboard shortcuts.

---

3. Understandable
Make UI behavior predictable and input easy to correct.

1. Consistent Labels & Roles  
   - Enforce accessible_role from ARIA roles table.  
   - Provide a builtin map:
     `python
     ARIA_ROLES = {
       "Button": "button",
       "Entry": "textbox",
       # …
     }
     `
2. Error Prevention & Assistance  
   - On invalid input (e.g. in AccessibleEntry), announce the error:
     `python
     def validate(self, predicate, message):
         if not predicate(self.get()):
             speak(message)
             return False
         return True
     `
3. Predictable Focus  
   - Do not steal focus when opening dialogs; announce new windows.

---

4. Robust
Ensure compatibility with assistive technologies and future browsers/tools.

1. ARIA & OS‐Level Integration  
   - Windows (UIA): use comtypes to set AutomationProperties.Name & HelpText.  
   - Linux (AT-SPI): use pyatspi to register accessible objects with proper interfaces.  
   - macOS (VoiceOver): wrap underlying NSAccessibility APIs via pyobjc.  
   - Abstract this in platform_adapter.py:
     `python
     def setautomationname(widget, name):
         if sys.platform.startswith("win"):
             # comtypes.UIA_API call
         elif sys.platform.startswith("linux"):
             # pyatspi.Registry.registerAccessible(...)
     `
2. Type-Safe Stubs & Metadata  
   - Keep your generate_stubs.py in CI so IDEs pick up ARIA properties.

---

5. Automated Accessibility Testing
Integrate checks into CI to catch regressions early.

1. Unit Tests  
   - For each widget, assert:
     `python
     assert widget.accessible_name
     assert widget.accessiblerole in ARIAROLES.values()
     `
2. End-to-End with Screen Reader  
   - On Windows, use pya11y or NVDA’s COM API to query focused element properties.  
   - On Linux, use pytest-atspi to verify AT-SPI tree nodes.
3. Contrast & Keyboard  
   - Add smoke tests using axe-core-pytest to validate contrast ratios.

---

6. Documentation & Conformance Report

1. WCAG Conformance  
   - Publish an “Accessibility Conformance Report” (ACR) in docs/ACR.md, stating which WCAG 2.1 Level AA criteria you meet and how.
2. Developer Guide  
   - In docs/, add a11y guidelines: “How to add new widgets,” “ARIA role mapping,” “Platform adapters.”
3. User Guide  
   - Show how end-apps can customize announcements, change voices, override colors.

---

7. Continuous Improvement

- User Feedback Loop: integrate a feedback widget in your apps to collect real-world accessibility issues.  
- Community Audit: host regular A11y sprints, invite users of screen readers/dyslexic fonts.  
- Roadmap Alignment: add accessibility tasks to your public roadmap with priority and status.

Next Steps

1. Create platform_adapter.py stubs and prototype one OS integration.  
2. Write unit tests for your mixins and utilities to enforce ARIA roles and names.  
3. Add automated contrast and focus-visibility checks to CI.  
4. Draft your WCAG ACR in docs/ACR.md.  
5. Iterate with screen-reader users (NVDA, VoiceOver) to catch edge cases.

Implementing the above will align tkaria11y with all major accessibility standards—making it a robust, inclusive framework that end-users and assistive technologies can trust.
