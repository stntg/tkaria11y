# Pylint Fixes Summary

## Overview

Fixed pylint issues in the migration demo files, improving code quality from **8.91/10** to **9.89/10**.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Docstrings (C0115, C0116)

- Added class docstrings to `SimpleCalculatorApp` classes
- Added method docstrings to all functions and methods
- All public methods now have proper documentation

### 2. Unused Imports (W0611)

- Removed unused `ttk` imports from multiple files
- Removed unused `os` and `shutil` imports from `demo_migration.py`

### 3. Variable Assignment Issues (E0606)

- Fixed "possibly using variable 'result' before assignment" by initializing `result = 0` before conditional blocks
- Applied to both `before_migration.py` and `after_before_migration.py`

### 4. Too Many Local Variables (R0914)

- Refactored `create_form()` functions to reduce local variable count
- Used list comprehensions and loops to eliminate intermediate variables
- Reduced from 17 variables to under 15 in both form files

### 5. Import Position Issues (C0413)

- Moved `from tkaria11y.scripts.migrate import TkinterToA11yTransformer` to proper position
- Reorganized imports in `demo_migration.py`

### 6. Line Too Long (C0301)

- Split long lines in `demo_migration.py` to comply with 100-character limit

### 7. Redefined Outer Name (W0621)

- Changed parameter name from `root` to `main_window` in form creation functions
- Fixed variable name conflicts in `after_simple_form.py` and `simple_form.py`

### 8. F-string Without Interpolation (W1309)

- Replaced unnecessary f-strings with regular strings in `demo_migration.py`

### 9. Import Outside Toplevel (C0415)

- Moved tkaria11y widget imports to module level in `complete_demo.py`
- Added availability check with `TKARIA11Y_AVAILABLE` flag

### 10. Too Many Statements (R0915)

- Refactored large `create_demo_apps()` function into smaller functions
- Split functionality into `create_original_app()`, `create_accessible_app()`, and `run_demo_choice()`

## Remaining Issues

### Duplicate Code (R0801)

The remaining duplicate code warnings are **intentional** and expected:

- `before_migration.py` and `after_before_migration.py` share similar code by design
- These files demonstrate the migration process with before/after examples
- The duplication shows what changes during migration
- Similar patterns exist in the form examples

## Files Modified

1. `after_before_migration.py` - Fixed docstrings, imports, variable initialization
2. `before_migration.py` - Fixed docstrings, imports, variable initialization  
3. `after_simple_form.py` - Fixed docstrings, imports, variable names, reduced locals
4. `simple_form.py` - Fixed docstrings, imports, variable names, reduced locals
5. `demo_migration.py` - Fixed imports, line length, f-strings, variable names
6. `complete_demo.py` - Fixed imports, function size, statement count
7. `test_file.py` - Added missing docstring

## Final Score

- **Before**: 8.91/10
- **After**: 9.89/10
- **Improvement**: +0.98 points

The code now follows Python best practices and pylint standards while maintaining full functionality.
