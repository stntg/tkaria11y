# High Contrast Theme Improvements

## Problem Solved

You were absolutely right! The original high contrast theme implementation had a critical flaw:

**❌ OLD BEHAVIOR:**

- Only themed widgets that existed when `HighContrastTheme.apply()` was called
- Widgets created AFTER applying the theme would have normal colors
- No persistent theming for the entire application
- Required manual theming of each new widget

**✅ NEW BEHAVIOR:**

- Themes ALL widgets in the entire application window
- Automatically themes NEW widgets created after `apply()` is called
- Uses Tkinter's option database for persistent, application-wide theming
- Can be toggled on/off dynamically
- Works with both standard tkinter and accessible widgets

## Technical Improvements Made

### 1. **Option Database Integration**

```python
# NEW: Set default colors for ALL widgets using Tkinter's option database
root.option_add("*Background", "black")
root.option_add("*Foreground", "white")
root.option_add("*Button.Background", "black")
root.option_add("*Entry.Background", "black")
# ... and many more widget-specific defaults
```

This ensures that ANY widget created after the theme is applied will automatically use the high contrast colors.

### 2. **Automatic Theme Monitoring**

```python
# NEW: Automatically check for and theme new widgets
def auto_theme_new_widgets():
    if root in cls._themed_roots:
        cls._apply_to_children(root)
        root.after(100, auto_theme_new_widgets)  # Check every 100ms

root.after(100, auto_theme_new_widgets)
```

A background process continuously monitors for new widgets and themes them automatically.

### 3. **Comprehensive Widget Support**

The new implementation supports ALL tkinter widget types:

- Button, Label, Entry, Frame, Toplevel
- Text, Canvas, Listbox, Scale
- Checkbutton, Radiobutton, Menu, Menubutton
- Special handling for widget-specific properties (like Entry fieldBackground, Scale troughColor)

### 4. **Theme State Tracking**

```python
# NEW: Track which root windows have the theme applied
_themed_roots: weakref.WeakSet = weakref.WeakSet()

@classmethod
def is_applied(cls, root: tk.Tk) -> bool:
    return root in cls._themed_roots
```

### 5. **Dynamic Theme Removal**

```python
# NEW: Properly remove themes and restore defaults
@classmethod
def remove(cls, root: tk.Tk) -> None:
    cls._themed_roots.discard(root)
    # Reset option database to standard colors
    # Apply standard colors to existing widgets
```

### 6. **Enhanced AccessibleApp Integration**

```python
# NEW: Theme control methods in AccessibleApp
def enable_high_contrast(self) -> None
def disable_high_contrast(self) -> None  
def toggle_high_contrast(self) -> bool
def is_high_contrast_enabled(self) -> bool
```

## Demonstration

### Test Files Created

1. **`simple_theme_test.py`** - Basic demonstration of the improved theming
2. **`theme_demo.py`** - Interactive demo with before/after comparison
3. **`complete_theme_example.py`** - Comprehensive example with AccessibleApp

### What the Tests Show

#### Before Applying Theme

```text
🎨 Normal colors for all widgets
📝 Standard system fonts
🔲 Regular contrast levels
```

#### After Applying Theme

```text
🎨 High contrast colors (black background, white text)
📝 All widgets themed consistently  
🔲 Yellow selection highlights for better visibility
✨ NEW widgets automatically get themed!
```

#### Dynamic Widget Creation

```python
# Create new widgets AFTER theme is applied
new_button = tk.Button(parent, text="New Button")
new_entry = tk.Entry(parent)
new_label = tk.Label(parent, text="New Label")

# ✅ These automatically have high contrast colors!
# ❌ OLD: Would have normal colors
# ✅ NEW: Automatically themed
```

## Real-World Impact

### For Users

- **Consistent Experience**: All parts of the application have the same high contrast appearance
- **Better Accessibility**: No "missed" widgets that remain hard to see
- **Dynamic Theming**: Theme changes apply to dialog boxes, pop-ups, and dynamically created content

### For Developers

- **Zero Extra Work**: Just call `HighContrastTheme.apply(root)` once
- **No Manual Theming**: New widgets are automatically themed
- **Easy Integration**: Works with existing tkinter code without changes
- **Toggle Support**: Can enable/disable themes at runtime

## Example Usage

### Simple Usage

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkaria11y.themes import HighContrastTheme

root = tk.Tk()
HighContrastTheme.apply(root)  # Themes everything!

# All these widgets are automatically themed:
tk.Label(root, text="Hello").pack()
tk.Entry(root).pack()
tk.Button(root, text="Click Me").pack()

root.mainloop()
```

### With AccessibleApp

```python
from tkaria11y import AccessibleApp

# Enable high contrast from the start
app = AccessibleApp(title="My App", high_contrast=True)

# Or toggle it dynamically
app.toggle_high_contrast()  # Enable/disable
app.enable_high_contrast()  # Force enable
app.disable_high_contrast() # Force disable

# All widgets in the app are automatically themed!
```

### Dynamic Theme Control

```python
# Create app without theme
app = AccessibleApp(title="My App")

# Add some widgets
create_initial_widgets()

# Later, enable theme - ALL widgets change instantly
app.enable_high_contrast()

# Add more widgets - they're automatically themed
create_more_widgets()

# Toggle theme off - everything returns to normal
app.disable_high_contrast()
```

## Conclusion

The improved high contrast theme now works exactly as expected:

✅ **Complete Application Theming** - Every widget gets themed  
✅ **Automatic New Widget Theming** - No manual work required  
✅ **Dynamic Toggle Support** - Can be enabled/disabled at runtime  
✅ **Persistent Theming** - Uses Tkinter's option database properly  
✅ **Zero Breaking Changes** - Existing code continues to work  

Your observation was spot-on - the theme should apply to the **entire application window including all widgets**, and now it does! 🎉
